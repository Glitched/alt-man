# alt-man

Mostly a joke project, this is a GPT-powered alternative to the `man` command. Summon the full power of Sam Altman to explain the syntax for obscure commands.

Written in Rust because aren't all the trendy command line tools? Really, I just wanted an excuse to play around with it.

It doens't work quite yet, but it can't be too much longer.

## Usage

Add an OpenAI API key in your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
